When identifying elements in playwright tests using locator, prefer using Id if it is a single element, or class if there could be more than 1 element. If the element needs an Id or class, add it in the client project.
Do not attempt to install the Playwright browsers, and do not attempt to run the tests. These tests are only intended to be run locally.
