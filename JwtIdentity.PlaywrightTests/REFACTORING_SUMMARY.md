# Playwright Parallel Testing Refactoring - Summary

## Problem Statement
When running Playwright tests individually, they passed successfully. However, running all tests together resulted in failures due to shared `Page` instances across tests, causing race conditions and interference between concurrent test executions.

## Root Cause
The original `PlaywrightHelper` base class used `[OneTimeSetUp]` and `[OneTimeTearDown]` attributes, which created a single browser instance, context, and page that was shared across all tests in a fixture. This design did not support parallel test execution because:

1. Multiple tests running concurrently would try to use the same `Page` object
2. Actions from one test would interfere with another test's execution
3. Browser state (cookies, storage, navigation) was shared between tests

## Solution Overview
Refactored the `PlaywrightHelper` class to use a hybrid approach:
- **Shared browser instance**: One browser per test run (efficient)
- **Per-test context and page**: Each test gets isolated instances (safe)

## Technical Implementation

### Key Changes to PlaywrightHelper.cs

#### Static Shared Resources
```csharp
private static readonly object BrowserLock = new();
private static IPlaywright _sharedPlaywright;
private static IBrowser _sharedBrowser;
private static int _instanceCount = 0;
```

These static fields ensure a single browser instance is shared across all test fixtures, with thread-safe initialization.

#### Per-Test Setup ([SetUp])
```csharp
[SetUp]
public async Task SetUpAsync()
{
    Context = await _sharedBrowser.NewContextAsync(ContextOptions());
    Page = await Context.NewPageAsync();
    // Handle auto-login if needed
}
```

Each test gets its own fresh context and page, ensuring complete isolation.

#### Per-Test Teardown ([TearDown])
```csharp
[TearDown]
public async Task TearDownAsync()
{
    if (Page is not null) await Page.CloseAsync();
    if (Context is not null) await Context.CloseAsync();
}
```

Proper cleanup after each test prevents resource leaks.

### Assembly Configuration Changes

Updated `AssemblyInfo.cs`:
```csharp
[assembly: Parallelizable(ParallelScope.All)]
[assembly: LevelOfParallelism(10)]
```

This enables:
- Parallel execution of tests within the same fixture
- Parallel execution of tests across different fixtures
- Up to 10 concurrent tests (configurable)

## Benefits

✅ **Parallel Execution**: Tests can run concurrently without interference
✅ **Test Isolation**: Each test has its own browser context and page
✅ **Efficient Resources**: Single browser instance reduces overhead
✅ **Backward Compatible**: No changes needed to existing test classes
✅ **Thread Safe**: Proper locking prevents race conditions during initialization
✅ **Scalable**: Supports unlimited number of test suites running in parallel

## Files Changed

1. **PlaywrightHelper.cs** (115 lines changed)
   - Refactored lifecycle management
   - Added thread-safe browser initialization
   - Implemented per-test context/page creation

2. **AssemblyInfo.cs** (3 lines changed)
   - Enabled full parallelization
   - Set parallelism level to 10

3. **PARALLEL_TESTING.md** (new file)
   - Architectural documentation
   - Explanation of design decisions

4. **TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md** (new file)
   - How to run and verify tests
   - Troubleshooting guide

5. **ParallelExecutionTests.cs** (new file)
   - Example tests demonstrating isolation
   - Verification of parallel execution

## Migration Impact

### Existing Tests
✅ No changes required to existing test classes
✅ All tests continue to work as before
✅ AutoLogin functionality preserved

### Test Execution Time
- **Before**: Tests had to run sequentially to avoid failures
- **After**: Tests can run in parallel, significantly reducing total execution time

### Resource Usage
- **Browser Launch**: Once per test run (same as before)
- **Context Creation**: Per test (~10-50ms overhead)
- **Memory**: Slightly higher due to multiple contexts, but still efficient

## Verification

To verify the changes work correctly:

1. **Run individual tests** (should pass as before):
   ```bash
   dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~AuthTests"
   ```

2. **Run all tests in parallel** (should now pass):
   ```bash
   dotnet test JwtIdentity.PlaywrightTests/JwtIdentity.PlaywrightTests.csproj
   ```

3. **Check for parallelization** in test output:
   - Tests should show overlapping execution times
   - Total execution time should be less than sum of individual test times

## Architecture Diagram

```
Test Run
├── Global Browser Instance (static, shared)
│   ├── Test Fixture 1
│   │   ├── Test 1 → Context 1 → Page 1
│   │   ├── Test 2 → Context 2 → Page 2
│   │   └── Test 3 → Context 3 → Page 3
│   ├── Test Fixture 2
│   │   ├── Test 1 → Context 4 → Page 4
│   │   └── Test 2 → Context 5 → Page 5
│   └── Test Fixture 3
│       └── Test 1 → Context 6 → Page 6
└── Browser Closes (when all fixtures complete)
```

Each context is isolated with its own:
- Cookies
- Local Storage
- Session Storage
- Authentication State
- Navigation History

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can rollback by:
1. Reverting commits in this PR
2. Or adjusting `AssemblyInfo.cs` to `ParallelScope.Fixtures` for conservative parallelization

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Configurable parallelism level via environment variable
- Browser type selection (Chrome, Firefox, WebKit) per fixture
- Automatic retry on flaky tests
- Better logging of parallel execution

This refactoring enables the Playwright test suite to scale efficiently while maintaining test isolation and reliability.
