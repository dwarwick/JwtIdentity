## Documentation search
- The documentation search database automatically syncs daily at 2:00 AM by scanning the documentation .razor pages.
- This ensures that search results always return the most up-to-date information from the live documentation pages.
- The sync process runs as a background job and does not impact system performance.
- You only need to update the .razor files in the Client project - the build process automatically copies them to the server for indexing, ensuring they're available even when deployed.
