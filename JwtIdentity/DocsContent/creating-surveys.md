# Creating Surveys

## Use AI to jump-start your survey
- Check **Use AI to Generate Questions** when you create a new survey.
- Provide optional guidance in the **Instructions to AI** box to steer tone, length, or audience.
- Review the suggestions; you can edit, delete, or add manual questions at any time.
- Only the survey description and instructions are sent to the AI service—no personal data is shared.

## Create a new survey shell
- Sign in and navigate to **Surveys > Create Survey**.
- Enter a descriptive title and summary that set expectations for respondents.
- Choose **Create** to open the question builder.

## Build out your questions
- Use the builder to add prompts.
- Choose a question type (Text, Multiple Choice, Select All That Apply, True/False, or Rating 1–10).
- Write the prompt and helper text, then add answer options for choice questions.
- Select **Add Question** to save each entry.

## Edit existing questions
- Select a question from the list to load it into the editor.
- Update wording, helper text, or answer options and choose **Add Question** again to save.
- Question types cannot be changed after creation—delete and recreate the question if you need a new type.

## Reuse questions from your library
- Expand **Start with Existing Question** to browse reusable content.
- Search by keyword and select a question to copy its wording, type, and options.
- Customize the copied prompt so it fits the new context.
- Reuse is ideal for recurring onboarding, satisfaction, or compliance surveys.
