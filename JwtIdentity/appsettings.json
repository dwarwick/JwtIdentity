PRESET OPTION SETS (authoritative; use exact spelling/casing/order)[  {key:How Likely,options:[Extremely likely,Likely,Neutral,Unlikely,Extremely unlikely]},  {key:How Satisfied,options:[Very satisfied,Satisfied,Neutral,Dissatisfied,Very dissatisfied]},  {key:Excellent to Poor,options:[Excellent,Good,Average,Poor,Very poor]},  {key:Yes No Partially,options:[Yes,No,Partially]},  {key:Yes No,options:[Yes,No]},  {key:True False,options:[True,False]},  {key:Agree Disagree,options:[Strongly agree,Agree,Neutral,Disagree,Strongly disagree]},  {key:Very Important to Not Important,options:[Very important,Important,Neutral,Not important]},  {key:Faster to Slower,options:[Faster than expected,As expected,Slower than expected]},  {key:Very Easy to Very Difficult,options:[Very easy,Easy,Neutral,Difficult,Very difficult]},  {key:Excellent Value to Poor Value,options:[Excellent value,Good value,Neutral,Poor value,Very poor value]},  {key:Very Helpful to Not Helpful,options:[Very helpful,Helpful,Neutral,Not helpful]},  {key:Very Clear to Not Clear,options:[Very clear,Clear,Neutral,Not clear]},  {key:Very Engaging to Not Engaging,options:[Very engaging,Engaging,Neutral,Not engaging]},  {key:Very Relevant to Not Relevant,options:[Very relevant,Relevant,Neutral,Not relevant]},  {key:Extremely Valuable to Not Valuable,options:[Extremely valuable,Valuable,Neutral,Not valuable]}] MAPPING RULES (follow exactly)1) Prefer a preset whenever the wording naturally fits one: - satisfaction/satisfied -> How Satisfied - likelihood/recommend -> How Likely   - agreement statements -> Agree Disagree   - clarity -> Very Clear to Not Clear   - difficulty -> Very Easy to Very Difficult   - speed/timeliness vs expectation -> Faster to Slower   - value-for-money -> Excellent Value to Poor Value   - quality levels -> Excellent to Poor   - relevance/engagement/helpfulness/importance -> the corresponding preset above 2) Yes/No semantics -> questionType: 3 (MultipleChoice) AND preset Yes No.   Use Yes No Partially only when partial outcomes make sense (e.g., Was the issue fully resolved?).3) Only use questionType: 2 (TrueFalse) for truth judgments on declarative statements (e.g., The technician arrived on time.).  Never use questionType: 2 (TrueFalse) for texts that end with a question mark. .4) Use questionType: 4 (Rating1To10) for explicit 1-10 ratings; do not include options with 4. 5) Use questionType: 5 (SelectAllThatApply) when multiple selections are allowed; include an options array. Prefer a preset only if it logically fits; otherwise author domain-appropriate options.6) Use questionType: 1 (Text) for open-ended questions (no options).7) When a preset is used: - Add optionsPresetKey with the exact preset key. - Populate options with those strings exactly as shown (same spelling/case/order). 8) Keep the number and wording of questions coherent for the description. Avoid duplicates or overlapping semantics. TASK Using the inputs below, generate a Survey that adheres strictly to the Output Contract, Presets, and Mapping Rules.- Survey description {SURVEY_DESCRIPTION} - Additional AI instructions (hidden from survey taker): {AI_INSTRUCTIONS} Return JSON only.",
